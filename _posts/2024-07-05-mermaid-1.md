Fairytales paint mermaids as creatures of beauty and allure, but what happens if our happily ever after crumbles? We lure sailors with enchanting songs, but what do we do when the song turns into a lament and the depths become a prison? 

This is my story. I'm certainly not trapped by a witch's curse but love has beautifully drowned me. This is my sad song. 

He was my sun, brighter than any bioluminescent creature in the deepest trench. His voice, deeper than the ocean floor, spoke straight to my soul. Intelligent, gentle, kind, his eyes held the secrets of the universe, his heart a radiant being of pure gold. It felt like the ocean herself chose him for me. He was the man chosen to be loved by me. We were one, with fingers, bodies and souls intertwined, like two halves of a pearl. Our companionship bloomed like the brightest flowers underwater, and I couldn't stop myself from yearning for a future woven from moonlight and seaweed, with him by my side.

Within his wisdom and kindness, there resided a restlessness similar to the ocean waves. He longed to breach the boundaries, to jump out of the sea until the sun shone on his face- something he always spoke about with stars in his eyes. His heart only denies to accept mediocrity, always aching for the unknown hoping to find himself there. He was reluctant to swim the familiar waves, amongst his kin and the known. He was courageous, a soul of such immense strength that with each passing day, he unknowingly drowned a little piece of me.

Now, he ventures into a world beyond the ocean's grasp, away from me. Will he ever return?

Will my heart rediscover its rhythm, or will the ocean forever echo with the emptiness of his absence? Will he dream of me in his surface world? As my tears dissolve into ocean water, will his heart recall our time together? Will I ever find love again, or am I destined to be a sad song in silent depths forever? 

Will he return? A question that screams in silence, a single word holding the weight of my world.
