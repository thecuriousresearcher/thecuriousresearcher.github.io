#### 21 July 21:36 PM
It was a good day, I've never seen this city so beautiful. It was pouring the entire time and it was so damn cold. I did something brave today- wore a dress to a restaurant and mall. I was always the pants girl, considering I am really tall and I have strawberry skin (clogged pores) throughout my legs. I never really found the confidence to reveal my legs in public places. I feel really good. J told me I'm very pretty, million times. He was being a total heart eyes emoji. It is important to have people who hype you up. We had an amazing buffet, but I was full from the starters. J asked the restaurant guys to play "Maan meri jaan" for me- my heart was literally racing. I kept asking him if it was playing for me, and he said yes. I'm so emotional, so happy! We went for shopping and he got me the best umbrella to ever exist, push up bars and countable skipping rope. Can you believe that? J confuses me- as much as he does all the confusing things, I know he does care for me and adores me. I'm excited, I'll have to do something great in life. Something huge, something great!
