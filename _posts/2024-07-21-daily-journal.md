It was a good day, I've never seen this city look so beautiful. It was pouring the entire time and it was very cold. I did something brave today- wore a knee-length dress to a restaurant and mall. I was always the pants girl, considering I am really tall and I have strawberry skin (clogged pores) throughout my legs. Until today, I never really found the confidence to reveal my legs in public places. I feel really good. J told me I'm very pretty: a million times. He was being a total heart eyes emoji. I feel it is really important to have people who hype you up. We had an amazing buffet for lunch, but I was full from the starters. J asked the restaurant guys to play "Maan meri jaan" for me- no kidding but my heart was literally racing. I kept asking him if it was playing for me, and he said yes. I'm so emotional, so happy! We went for shopping and he got me the best umbrella to ever exist, push up bars and countable skipping rope. Can you believe that? J confuses me- as much as he does all the confusing things, I know he does care for me and adores me. I'm excited, I'll have to do something great in life. Something huge, something great, something meaningful, and I will be tracking all of that.

The last few days were crazy, couldn't journal much. I did things I would have never done in my life- yes, really strange things. It makes me feel like a grown woman, a little irresponsible one though. I'm only hoping I'm protected by the higher power. Otherwise, today's great! I got some new Airpods, and it looks so beautiful! It's the 4th product in my apple ecosystem, apple is just the best. I had a productive day at work, lots of calls. I limited my coffee cups to two, and I have been discussing with mature people about life. I guess I've to stop acting like a baby and take ownership of everything. Everything is in my control, literally everything. I'm happy today, God. Thank you. 

To read: The 48 Laws of Power (It talks about how the emotions and tongue can ruin your life- something I will have to learn more about). Thanks to the person who recommended me this, I really needed it.
