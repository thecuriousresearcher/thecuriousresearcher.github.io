It was a good day, I've never seen this city look so beautiful. It was pouring the entire time and it was very cold. I did something brave today- wore a knee-length dress to a restaurant and mall. I was always the pants girl, considering I am really tall and I have strawberry skin (clogged pores) throughout my legs. Until today, I never really found the confidence to reveal my legs in public places. I feel really good. J told me I'm very pretty: a million times. He was being a total heart eyes emoji. I feel it is really important to have people who hype you up. We had an amazing buffet for lunch, but I was full from the starters. J asked the restaurant guys to play "Maan meri jaan" for me- no kidding but my heart was literally racing. I kept asking him if it was playing for me, and he said yes. I'm so emotional, so happy! We went for shopping and he got me the best umbrella to ever exist, push up bars and countable skipping rope. Can you believe that? J confuses me- as much as he does all the confusing things, I know he does care for me and adores me. I'm excited, I'll have to do something great in life. Something huge, something great, something meaningful, and I will be tracking all of that.

The last few days were crazy, couldn't journal much. I did things I would have never done in my life- yes, really strange things. It makes me feel like a grown woman, a little irresponsible one though. I'm only hoping I'm protected by the higher power. Otherwise, today's great! I got some new Airpods, and it looks so beautiful! It's the 4th product in my apple ecosystem, apple is just the best. I had a productive day at work, lots of calls. I limited my coffee cups to two, and I have been discussing with mature people about life. I guess I've to stop acting like a baby and take ownership of everything. Everything is in my control, literally everything. I'm happy today, God. Thank you. 

To read: The 48 Laws of Power (It talks about how the emotions and tongue can ruin your life- something I will have to learn more about). Thanks to the person who recommended me this, I really needed it.

Is it weird that I'm journaling around noon? Well, I felt like it. How have I been? Okay I guess, but I am trying to make small progresses in life that is going to help me grow. I've been feeling sick but I haven't curved myself into a ball inside my blanket for the whole day- which is in itself 'growth' for me. I walked for 30 minutes in the morning on my terrace and it was magical. It was drizzling slightly. I started by listening to "Kahin door jab din dhal jaaye", I felt my heart warm up in this cold weather. I also found this playlist on spotify called '2008 Bollywood' and no kidding my childhood was back in a second. I dance-walked on Dance Pe Chance, Phir milenge chalte chalte, and would you believe if I told you I still remember the dance steps to Dil Haara re? Saifu was so sexy back then, hehe. I also listened to these beautiful melodies- Khuda Jaane, I always wished some guy would dedicate this for me- this song personified love for me in childhood (I never liked RK with Deepika though- gave her depression, didn't he?) Well, I will now tell you where the magic happened and why I'm journaling in the middle of the day. I was listening to Guzarish (Ghajini), and when Javed Ali sang the line 'Khushiyon ki Baarish' (translation to rain of happiness), the slightly drizziling weather turned into heavy downpour at the very second. It made me so hopeful! Your girl hasn't been well since the start of this year, life has been stuck- it literally didn't move. Things are looking better now, and I'm hoping it would. For all I got is myself, and I will do it for myself. I deserve the best. I really do!

Amazing quotes from the book I'm reading currently:
1. Author, Book name: Michiko Aoyama, What You Are Looking For Is in the Library
2. Quote 1: In a world where you don't know what will happen next, I just do what I can right now.
3. Quote 2: If you can survive the ordeal of being born, you can get through anything.
4. Quote 3: There are so many things to do, but I wonâ€™t make the excuse that I have no time anymore. Instead, I will think about what I can do with the time I have. One day is going to become tomorrow.

I do not know what to say. I spent my day curved up in my blanket trying to understand how things went out of control. I slept for a few hours, and then woke up anxious about not doing great in life. Nobody to love, nobody to call mine, no work that I love, no place I want to belong, nothing that inspires and excites me- do I need therapy? I've tried therapy before, and it never worked. I need like a slap on my face, a magic from above, a connection with God, a friend- and all of it I guess. I sometimes wonder if I'm born to only talk about my problems. I just need God. I really do. Where do I find God? I need to meet him.

I am sick today (a 101 fever). I called in leave at work, and spent the day sleeping. Why do I sleep all the time and still feel tired? What is it that is pushing me down? I have to pull my shit together. This fever is the last time I'm resting- once I am back, I am not going to let any shit take over. Everything will be in my control. I'm angry and the world can't afford to hold an angry me. Goodnight.

Still sick, I was barely able to finish half dosa for breakfast. It looks like my new roommate is a sweetie but I'm too scared to let anybody close. I love my laptop, but I am finding less and less motivation to fire it everyday. This sickness, this pain, this resting period is the last time. Once I'm back on my feet, I assure you things are going to be okay. I'm treating this week as my respawn period. Once everything goes back to normal, I'll have lots of amazing stories to tell. Goodnight, love.
